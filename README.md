# Media-archive
Mobile optimized Media converter

I want to create a script that converts images and videos from my home media archive to a smaller format that fits my Android phone. 

Recently, I was shown a similar Cloud feature on the Iphone, but I immediately noticed some drawbacks of this approach (especially when there is no internet connection). Anyway, it pushed me to this idea.

You could say it's a Thumbnails generator.

I am sure that many people have already implemented similar software before. Moreover, it can most likely be done with a few commands in a terminal or a simple bash script. But I just want to experiment and make something from scratch.
